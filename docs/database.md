# Database Schema and Notes

This document outlines some notes for myself or those trying to understand
the system at a deeper level.

There are inconsistencies with singular versus plural names, which is
unfortunate but difficult at this point to remediate.  Please remember that
this is a one-man, spare-time project worked on intermittently over the
course of some years.  So, unfortunately, inconsistencies such as this
aren't rare.

Ecto, the database layer that the project uses, enforces an `id` field
which I omit in the tables below to save space.

## Tables

### character_figures (TODO)
### character_resources (TODO)
### characters (TODO)
### faction_figures (TODO)
### figures (TODO)
### news_item (TODO)
### role_figures (TODO)
### roles (TODO)
### scenario_factions (TODO)
### scenario_resources (TODO)

Records represent a resource for a scenario.

| Field | Type | Notes|
|-------|------|-------|
| scenario_id | int8 | FK to `scenarios.is` |
| resource_type | | a [Scenario Resource Type] value
| book | int4 | a [Books] value
| page | int4 |
| url | text |
| notes | text | unused |
| sort_order | int4 | 1..n
| inserted_at | timestamp
| updated_at | timestamp
| title | varchar(255) | display name for this resource
| issue | text |

The fields here are all nullable and at minimum the
`scenario_id` and `resource_type` should not be.

This table is effectively a union of print and online types.
`title` is meant to be used for either, although arguably it
shouldn't have been used for print materials, since the `book`
attribute describes the title.

`issue` might at first seem like it should be numeric, but
making it textual means it can handle things like "Summer 2018".
It could be `varchar(255)` instead of `text`, though.

It would probably have been better to bake the scenario
source directly into the [scenarios] table, which would
simplify searching by book.

### scenarios

Records represent a single scenario.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| name | varchar2(255) | |
| blurb | text | short explanation what the scenario represents |
| date_age | int4 | 1..4 for First Age ... Fourth Age |
| date_year | int4 | year within age |
| size | int4 | # of models used in the scenario |
| map_width | int4 | in inches |
| map_height | int4 | in inches |
| location | int4 | a [Locations] value |
| inserted_at | timestamp |
| updated_at | timestamp |
| date_month | 1-12 or <=0 if unknown |
| date_day | 1-31 or <=0 if unknown |
| rating | float4 | average rating |
| num_votes | int4 | # of votes which have been cast

Many fields (e.g. `name`, `blurb`) here are nullable but probably shouldn't be.

`rating` and `num_votes` are rolled up from the [user_scenarios] table and
are calculated by the application when a rating is made.

`num_votes` is the number of `user_scenario` records for the given scenario
which have a rating > 0. `rating` is then the average of those ratings.

### schema_migrations  (TODO)
### sessions (TODO)
### user_figure_history (TODO)
### user_figures (TODO)
### user_scenarios

Records represent the user-specific part of a scenario. There's a many-to-many
relationship between this table and the `scenarios` and `users` tables. But
there should be only one record per (user, scenario) combination.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| user_id | int4 | FK to `users.id` |
| rating | int4 | 1-5, or 0 if unrated |
| owned | int4 | how many of the needed models for the scenario the user owns |
| painted | int4 | how many of the needed models for the scenario the user has painted |
| scenario_id | int8 | FK to `scenarios.id` |
| inserted_at | timestamp
| updated_at | timestamp

`painted` should always be <= `owned`, which should in turn be <= `scenarios.size` for
the given scenario.  These rollup values are computed by the application whenever
the user buys, sells, or paints a figure.

### users

Records represent users.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| name | varchar(255) | NOT NULL |
| email | varchar(255) | NOT NULL |
| password_hash | varchar(255) | |
| inserted_at | timestamp | |
| updated_at | timestamp | |
| is_admin | bool | |

`name` is never actually used in the system, but is there so at least theoretically
I have a name if I need to contact folks in case of emergency.  Plus I find it
slightly amusing to see the variety of full names, first names, and aliases
which users are signing up with.

`is_admin` is required to use any of the admin-only services.  There's no way
to set this field for users other than directly editing the database.
