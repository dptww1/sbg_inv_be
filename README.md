# SBG_INV_BE

This is the `[S]`trategy `[B]`attle `[G]`ame `[Inv]`entory tracker - `[B]`ack `[E]`nd.

The game referred to is Games Workshop's Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game, which is a miniatures game
where in you refight the battles from the _Lord of the Rings_ books and movies.

This application provides services for users to see the available scenarios and the figures needed to play them.
Registered users can track their acquisition and painting progress to see what scenarios they can play based on
their current collection.

I expect most users would want to use these services through a front end providing a friendlier interface.  That's
what the [sbg_inv_fe](https://github.com/dptww1/sbg_inv_fe) project is for.

I hope eventually to provide API documentation, but you know how that goes.

This project was written in Elixir so that I could experiment with functional programming and see what all the
Elixir buzz was about.
